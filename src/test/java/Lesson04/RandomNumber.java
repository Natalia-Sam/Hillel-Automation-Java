//        Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is.
//        If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should display "Too high, try again."
//        If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program should display "Too low, try again."
//        The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.
//        To generate a random number between 0 and 10 use the following method:
//        int number = (int) (Math.random() * 10) + 1;
    }
