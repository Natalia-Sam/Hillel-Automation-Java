    public static void main(String[] args) {

//        Write a program to calculate average value of an array elements.
//        Example array: {3, 5, 7}
//        Expected output: The average is: 5.0

        
//        1. Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then print the multiplication table of that number.
//
//        2. Two numbers are entered through the keyboard. Write a program to find the value of one number raised to the power of another. (Do not use Java built-in method Math.pow)
//
//        3. Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number with the digits reversed and spaces between the digits. For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 5 4 3 2 1
//
//        4. Create an array of integers. Write a Java program to sum values of the array.
//
//        5. Write a program to calculate average value of an array elements.
//                Example array: {3, 5, 7}
//        Expected output:
//        The average is: 5.0
//
//        6. Write a program that takes a max number of rows from user and prints out # sign with the following pattern: first row ## and every following row increments qty by 1, so the second will be ###, third #### until we reach the qty of rows that was input by user.
//        Use loops, make validations for user input (negative, empty)
//        Example:
//        int max = 8; //this number must be read from console, user input
//
//        Output:
//##
//###
//####
//#####
//######
//#######
//########
//#########
//
//        7. Write a program that takes the numbers input by user till the user wants and as the result it will output the count of positive, negative and zeros entered. Use do while loop.
//                Example:
//        Numbers that were input by user: 5, -2, 45, 0, 23, 14, -3
//        Expected output:
//        You entered 4 positive, 2 negative and 1 zero values.
//
//        8. Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program should display "Too low, try again." The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.
//        To generate a random number between 0 and 10 use the following method:
//        int number = (int) (Math.random() * 10) + 1;
//
//        9. Ask user to input qty of elements in the array. Create an empty array of the given qty of elements. Write a program that fills in your empty array with numbers from 1 (at 0 index of your array) to the last array element. Print the resulting array into console.
//
//        10. The same as in task 9, create an empty array but fill it in by randomly generated numbers.
